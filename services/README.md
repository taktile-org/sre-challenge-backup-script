# Examples

Here is a list of services that produce data and interact with our S3.

* [`date-uploader`](./data-uploader) is a Python service that uploads the current date
* [`time-uploader`](./time-uploader) is a Bash service that uploads the current time
* [`random-uploader`](./random-uploader) is a JS service that uploads a random number for entropy

Feel free to use any of them as a starting point.
